# 0C Assignment

This assignment will help you to gain some more independent practice with reading and coding answers to Node tests.

### How To Run This Assignment

- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
- In the terminal, navigate to the directory where this assignment is locatedâ€”you can right-click on the containing folder and select "Integrated Terminal at Folder" to open a terminal window.
- Run `node prog.js` to run the tests.
- Code in `prog.js` to make the tests pass.
- Repeat the last two steps until all tests pass.

### A Note: Focus On Reading The Tests

This assignment is designed to help you practice reading tests and writing code to make them pass. You should not need to modify the tests in order to complete the assignment. Instead, focus on reading the tests to understand what they are asking for, and then write the code to make them pass. This is a skill that will be very important as you move forward in your coding journey. Pay careful attention to not just the test code, but the results of the tests as they're printed to the console.

### Assignment Instructions

- Write a function called `getFirstElement` that takes an array as an argument and returns the first element of the array.
- Write a function called `getLastElement` that takes an array as an argument and returns the last element of the array.
- Write a function called `reverseWithoutMutation` that takes an array as an argument and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order. It should _not_ mutate the original array.
- Write a function called `sortByLength` that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a new array with the strings sorted by length, from shortest to longest. It should also not mutate the original array.
- Write a function called `getFirstMatch` that takes an array of strings and a string as arguments and returns the first element in the array that includes the string. If there is no match, it should return `null`.
- Write a function called `getAllMatches` that takes an array of strings and a string as arguments and returns a new array with all elements in the array that match the string. If there are no matches, it should return an empty array.
